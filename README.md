# About Me

Hi, I’m **Likhith Anand** — a **Business and Engineering student (B.Eng.)** currently studying between **Technische Hochschule Würzburg-Schweinfurt (Germany)** and **Auburn University (USA)**.  

I combine **Engineering Design, ERP Systems, and Process Optimisation** with a strong foundation in **Industrial & Systems Engineering**. With international experience across **India, Germany, and the USA**, I bring a **global perspective** and strong cross-cultural teamwork skills.  

**What drives me?**  
I am passionate about **optimising production systems and integrating ERP solutions** to improve efficiency, reliability, and decision-making. My goal is to design smarter, more sustainable production systems that connect **business processes with engineering execution** through ERP and Industry 4.0 technologies.  

📌 Currently:  
- Projects in **ERP & Digital Transformation, Material Flow Optimisation and Product Development**  
- Expanding expertise in **Makerspace prototyping**, **Siemens Plant Simulation**, **Siemens NX Cad** and **DMAIC phases**.
